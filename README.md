# Supply Chain Analysis: Data Exploration and Visualization

## You going to see different types of plots I have used . Feel Free to explore them

### Streamlit Dashboard:

To complement the exploratory data analysis, I have created an interactive Streamlit dashboard. The dashboard provides real-time visualization and analysis of the supply chain data, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.

## Summary

Welcome to this notebook where I dive deep into the analysis of supply chain data. This notebook focuses on key metrics essential for understanding the performance and efficiency of supply chain operations.

### Objectives:

- **Data Exploration**: Gain insights into the supply chain data by exploring production volumes, stock levels, order quantities, revenue, costs, lead times, shipping costs, transportation routes, risks, and sustainability factors.
- **Visualization**: Create informative visualizations to better understand the relationships and distributions within the data.
- **Dashboard Development**: Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize the key metrics and facilitate real-time analysis.

### Key Sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Data cleaning and preparation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics.
   - Visualization of key metrics.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Production volumes, stock levels, and lead times.
   - Revenue distribution by location.
   - Manufacturing costs by supplier.
   - Comparison of price and manufacturing costs by product type.
   - Relationship between production volume, stock levels, and order quantities.
   - Distribution of shipping costs by shipping carriers.
   - Average lead time by product type.
   - Transportation routes and their frequency.
   - Supply chain risk distribution by risk factors.
   - Sustainability factors in the supply chain.
